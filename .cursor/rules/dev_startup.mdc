## Development Startup
ALWAYS use `./start_dev.sh` to start both frontend and backend development servers:
- This script automatically starts both Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend concurrently
- No need to manually start frontend and backend separately
- The script handles virtual environment activation and dependency checks
- Provides a single command to launch the entire development environment

## Startup Command
When starting development:
1. Make sure you're in the project root directory
2. Run: `./start_dev.sh`
3. The script will automatically:
   - Activate the virtual environment
   - Check and install frontend dependencies if needed
   - Start the FastAPI backend on http://localhost:8000
   - Start the Next.js frontend on http://localhost:3000

## What the Script Does
- Activates Python virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate`)
- Checks if frontend dependencies are installed (`frontend/node_modules`)
- Installs frontend dependencies if missing (`npm install` in frontend directory)
- Starts backend server (`python run.py`) in background
- Starts frontend server (`npm run dev` in frontend directory) in background
- Provides cleanup on CTRL+C to stop both servers

## Development URLs
After running `./start_dev.sh`:
- Frontend application: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Stopping Development
- Press CTRL+C to stop both servers simultaneously
- The script handles cleanup of background processes

## Troubleshooting
- If virtual environment is missing: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If frontend dependencies are missing: The script will automatically install them
- If ports are in use: Check for existing processes on ports 3000 and 8000

## Alternative Manual Startup (Not Recommended)
Only use manual startup for debugging specific issues:
- Backend: `source venv/bin/activate && python run.py`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
